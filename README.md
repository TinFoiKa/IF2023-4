# International Fair Miniprogram 2024-25
The source code for the 2024-25 International Fair Miniprogram for Shanghai American School Puxi. Pilot run of the extended development tea.

## Changes Made from IF23-4
This section and the *sections below* will be dedicated to the *goals* and *improvements* made since the original student developed International Fair Miniprogram, focusing on **[inefficiencies](#inefficiencies), [UI/UX](#ui-ux), Cybersecurity, readability,** and **functionality**.

To see full list including previous info, see ['Functionalities'](#functionalities)

### <p style = "color: lightgreen"> Additions </p>
1. [Interactive Map](#interactive-map)
2. Beginning Treasure Hunt
3. Administrative Questionairre
     
    > One large focus of this year's IF is to *advertise* the school to **non-student visitors**. The Questionnaire should be on 
    > school *culture* and *history* to encourage **socialization with school patrons**, and will be placed in the *treasure hunt*.

4. Complementary Bracelets
       
    > Last year, many special workers or visitors were given **paper tickets** to thank them for their work. This year, we'd like to
    > once again *cut down on paper* and provide **complementary bracelets** with a set charge, connected to a *seperate* system.
    > A seperate system, although odd, will let us determine whether scanning the QR codes will *add revenue* to individual club
    > booths or not
   
5. Cloud/better storage for large files (Advertisements, media, introductory materials)
6. Booth search/sort system
7. Club-sponsored quizzes in miniprogram events

### <p style = "color: lightblue"> Subtractions </p>
1. Sub-booths

    > **Political reasonings** affected how booths were ran last year. We're now officially coding in *sovereignity* for booths and 
    > giving them **individual management** systems. However, due to political reasons again, their **naming schemes** will still 
    > be set to **imply ownership.**

2. Functions-per-page
    
    > This year's miniprogram will plan to take a new stance on the **UI and UX** of the app, mostly with an *increase* in 
    > front-end developers to **decrease the complexity** of working with the app. More information in the **['UI, UX'](#ui-ux)**
    > section.

## Inefficiencies
Although the program worked well and was functional to a majority of people, certain people - such as those with more 'legacy' technologies - found far more difficulties running the program. These difficulties landed especially in loading media and in cloud functionality, leading us to believe there were inefficiencies in file management and loading, as well as for unnecessary complexity in cloud function code.
